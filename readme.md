#inline emoji

emoji as inlineable data-uris in JSON.


## What is this?

Not entirely sure yet. Will probably turn this into a little script for adding emoji to html.

## Why not just use https://github.com/hassankhan/emojify.js?

I want it all in as super simple text processing (without the CSS and DOM stuff) and I want to be able to do the text parsing and then DOMify the result.

## Is it ready to use?

no. But hey... if you want some nice JSON files with emoji data uris... then check the "output" folder.
